Various studies applied in Unity, C#.

## Rationale

This is a project where I applied in action my studies of the following resources:

- [Book. Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) - Bob Nystrom

- [Book. LevelUp!](https://www.amazon.com/Level-Guide-Great-Video-Design/dp/1118877160) - Scott Rogers

    > I am also a firm believer that almost ANYTHING can be made into gameplay

- [Article. Unity â€” Project Structure Best Practices!](https://sam-16930.medium.com/unity-project-structure-a694792cefed) - Samuel Asher Rivello

## Study results

There you can find examples of using the following:

- **Decoupling** input handling from logic
- **State** design pattern for character controller
- Good **project layout** ensuring that supports project organization. It also makes sure that nothing unnecessary goes into the build (e.g. dependency on Unity's Editor library)
- **Constant code formatting**
- A trick with not instantiating projectiles more than once per player
