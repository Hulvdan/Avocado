# Avocado

Various studies applied in Unity, C#.

![Avocado Throwing](./Documentation/avocado-throwing-loop.gif)

## Rationale

This project was done for educational and entertainment purposes.

Also, it could help with assessing the quality of my code during interviews.

## What I did

I applied my studies of the following resources:

- [Book. Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) - Bob Nystrom

- [Book. LevelUp!](https://www.amazon.com/Level-Guide-Great-Video-Design/dp/1118877160) - Scott Rogers

    > I am also a firm believer that almost ANYTHING can be made into gameplay

- [Article. Unity â€” Project Structure Best Practices!](https://sam-16930.medium.com/unity-project-structure-a694792cefed) - Samuel Asher Rivello

- [Video. Math for Game Programmers: Building a Better Jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG9SzQxaCm8) - at 2016 GDC talk, by Kyle Pittman

- [Video. How to Make a Good 2D Camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdWFzpgnljs) - Game Maker's Toolkit

## Study results

There you can find examples of using the following:

- [x] **Throwing seed!**
- [x] **Decoupling** input handling from logic
- [x] **State** design pattern for the character controller
  - [x] Movement
    - [x] Idle
    - [x] Running
  - [x] Jumping
  - [x] Falling
  - [x] Throwing seed
- [x] Good **project layout** that supports project organization. It also makes sure that nothing unnecessary goes into the build (e.g. dependency on Unity's Editor library)
- [x] **Constant code formatting**
- [x] A trick with not instantiating projectiles more than once per avocado controller

![Gravity and initial jump's velocity for achieving jump of specific duration and height](./Documentation/jump-formula.jpg)

- [x] :arrow_up: I got formulas of gravity and initial velocity for achieving a jump of specific duration and height
- [x] Movement
  - [x] Max movement speed
  - [x] Acceleration speed
- [x] Jumping
  - [x] Slower horizontal acceleration while mid-air
  - [x] Jump cutoff
  - [x] Duration til reaching the top point of the jump
  - [x] Higher gravity scale while falling
